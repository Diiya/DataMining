Name : Diiya Dasari 
UTA ID : 1001934969

Program : text-classifier-dm-mainproject-finalcode.ipynb

Language : Python version 3

Libraries : Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, tensorflow, os, nltk, re,numpy,wordcloud,plotly, seaborn, scipy, collections
 
Steps to execute the program :

Open a new kaggle notebook and import the kaggle dataset "ecommerce-product-review-data/Product Review Data.csv" as input.
Upload the ipynb file or copy and paste the contents of the ipynb file into kaggle notebook and run. 

Note : 
There could a lot of warnings thrown while running the code during hyper parameter tuning for logistic regression into the program as that couldn't be handled when coding.
The code can only be run on kaggle i.e by importing data through kaggle, it doesn't work on jupyter notebook locally, for this the input of data should be given differently.
